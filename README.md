# EVMrs

EVMrs is a personal learning project focused on exploring the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Rust programming language. It is based on the foundational code available at [evm-from-scratch](https://github.com/w1nt3r-eth/evm-from-scratch). This project serves as a platform for gaining hands-on experience and knowledge about EVM and Rust.

## State of the project
All tests run correctly. Two or three opcodes (e.g. SELFDESTRUCT) have mocked information that should be modified in case you want to implement the EVM in its entirety. Since these modifications did not add much, they were not made. The only thing left to do is to clean up the code.

## Disclaimer
Please note that this project is intended for my personal educational purposes only and should not be used in production environments. It may not be fully compliant with EVM specifications, and its performance and security have not been thoroughly tested.

## Contributing
